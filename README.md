üìÅ Project Structure
The repository contains the following files:

index.html: The main HTML file that structures the content of the webpage.

style.css: The custom CSS file for all styling and design rules.

assets/: A directory containing all the necessary images and video files used in the project.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
HTML5: Used for the semantic structure of the webpage.

CSS3: Custom styles to achieve the "pixel-perfect" design, including animations and hover effects.

Bootstrap 5.3: Utilized for the responsive grid system, utility classes, and pre-built components (e.g., the responsive navbar toggle).

Google Fonts: The Inter font is used to match the typography of the reference design.

Vanilla JavaScript: A small script is included to add a shadow effect to the header on scroll, creating a modern user experience.

‚ú® Features Implemented
Pixel-Perfect Design: The layout, typography, colors, and spacing are meticulously replicated from the reference image.

Fully Responsive: The design is optimized for various screen sizes, from large desktops to small mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Semantic HTML: The page is built with appropriate semantic tags (<header>, <main>, <section>, etc.) for better accessibility and SEO.

Interactive Elements:

Smooth scroll-triggered header shadow for a modern feel.

Hover effects on navigation links and buttons.

3D floating animation on the hero image.

Responsive Video Background: The final section features a responsive video background with a subtle overlay for enhanced readability.

Carousel-like UI: The training section uses a horizontally scrolling layout, providing a modern, dynamic feel without relying on a full-featured JavaScript carousel library.

üìù Notes & Challenges
Image Paths: All image and video assets are stored in the assets/ folder. The paths are relative, so ensure the folder structure remains intact after cloning the repository.

Typography: The Inter font family was chosen to closely match the clean, professional look of the reference design.

Responsive Design: The biggest challenge was ensuring the layouts, particularly the training cards and the "Volatility" section, maintained their visual integrity and spacing across a wide range of screen sizes. Bootstrap's grid system and custom media queries in style.css were crucial for this.

Animations: The floating 3D effect on the hero image and the smooth transitions on hover were implemented using custom CSS keyframes and transitions to add a touch of dynamic flair to the static elements.
